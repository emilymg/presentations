Differences in development are tied to:\\\n\n    -   uneven human social development\n    -   economic advancement of some human groups by furthering production & increasing wealth\n\n## Underdevelopment is always a comparison\n\n-   Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations (1776) - division of labor, productivity, free markets\n\n-   Africa, Asia, and Latin America can be said to be underdeveloped in *comparison* to Europe and North America. We can analyze underdevelopment by:\n\n    -   Comparing economic conditions in a single country or region over different time periods\n\n    -   Comparing two countries with one another in the same time period\n\n## Exploitation\n\n> All of the countries named as \"underdeveloped\" in the world are exploited by others; and the underdevelopment with which the world is now preoccupied is a product of capitalist, imperialist, and colonialist exploitation. \n\n \\\nAfrican and Asian societies that were developing independently were taken over by capitalist powers. Exploitation increased and export of surplus ensued; as a result the people are denied the benefit of their natural resources and labor. This is an *integral* mechanism of contemporary underdevelopment.\n\n## \"developing\" vs. \"underdeveloped\"\n\n-   Typically done to avoid interpretation as underdeveloped morally, physically, mentally, or any other connotation\n\n-   On the economic level, \"developing\" implies that Africa, Asia, and Latin America are escaping a state of backwardness relative to industrial nations and emancipating themselves from exploitation\n\n> Actually, if \"underdevelopment\" were related to anything other than comparing economies, then the most underdeveloped country in the world would be the United States, which practices external oppression on a massive scale, while internally there is a blend of exploitation, brutality, and psychiatric disorder.\n\n## How is underdevelopment measured?\n\nEconomists make comparisons by looking at:\\\n\n::: incremental\n-   What goods and services are produced\\\n-   National income (of countries)\\\n-   Per capita income (a national average)\\\n\\\nConsidering the state of development only in these ways, apart from the state of underdevelopment, hides gross inequalities in land distribution, property holding, and income behind national figures.\n:::\n\n::: notes\nLet's talk about math!\nZeros, missingness, and skewed wealth gaps: Why means & medians aren't very useful measures\nCould make income data more robust by breaking down in $ ranges, even with 0 as its own range, break down each into age groups, gender groups, etc\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-perCap layout-ncol=2}\n\n![1968 UN Data](1968_perCap.png)![2021 World Bank](perCap2021.png)\n\n::: \n\n2022 Multidimensional Poverty Index Report\nhttps://hdr.undp.org/content/2022-global-multidimensional-poverty-index-mpi#/indicies/MPI\n\n-   More than 50% of poor people (593 million) lack both electricity and clean cooking fuel.\n-   Almost 40% of poor people (437 million) lack access to both drinking water and sanitation.\n-   More than 30% of poor people (374 million) are deprived of nutrition, cooking fuel, sanitation and housing at the same time.",
